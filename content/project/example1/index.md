There's an indescribable joy that accompanies the act of immersing oneself deep in the pages of a good book. The sheer delight of losing track of time while navigating the intricate landscapes of words, where characters come alive, and stories unravel like enchanting tapestries, is unmatched. Each book is a doorway to a new adventure, a chance to live a thousand lives, and an invitation to explore endless possibilities. Every devoted reader knows the inescapable obstacle that is conquering the dreaded book hangover. A "book hangover" is defined by Epic Reads as a "condition in which attachment to a book or series that has ended causes the reader traumatic emotional distress". A book hangover can last for a few weeks, or until a new book of higher-than-average quality enters the readerâ€™s life.

This is when readers turn to their TBR (to-be-read) list. A TBR list is a collection of books that an individual plans to read in the future. Many avid readers maintain TBR lists to help prioritize their reading choices and ensure they don't forget about books they want to experience. The unfortunate aspect of this list is that it is ever growing and multiplies much quicker than the reader can keep up with. While assisting a reader in accelerating their book consumption isn't within my capability, aiding them in selecting the next compelling read from their TBR list is within my scope of assistance.

Determining the book that will aid a reader in recovering from a book hangover is the primary objective of this project. The goals of this endeavor encompass two key aspects:

- Creation of a predictive model to forecast what books from a reader's TBR list should be read next, with at least 51% accuracy
- Creation of a recommendation system, based off of nearly 6 million book ratings, to help readers continue to add to their TBR list
