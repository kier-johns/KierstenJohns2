Teaching is a rewarding yet demanding profession, a fact I can personally confirm from my experience as a high school math teacher. The combination of long working hours and a substantial workload makes it easy for educators to succumb to "teacher burnout." According to Psychology Today, burnout is characterized as "a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, detachment, and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment".

Without adequate support, teachers risk becoming overworked and neglecting their mental and physical well-being. Recognizing this challenge, BetterHelp, an online counseling platform with a mission to make "professional therapy accessible, affordable, and convenient", is launching the Educator Alliance Initiative (EAI). This initiative aims to provide free counseling services to educators, aiming to mitigate the prevalent issue of teacher burnout in the education system.

Once this initiative goes live, the organization is expecting a mass influx in inquires. With the expected surge in requests, it is crucial for the inquiry intake department to quickly, efficiently, and accurately assess eligibility of the candidate into the EAI. As part of this initiative, BetterHelp is developing a model, and they have sought my assistance in its construction. The model's purpose is to analyze incoming inquiries and predict, with a minimum accuracy of 90%, whether the individual qualifies for participation in the Educator Alliance Initiative.
