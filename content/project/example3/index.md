The Oppenheim twins, Jason and Brett Oppenheim, from the Netflix drama series, 'Selling Sunset', are launching their newest Oppenheim Group office in Ames, IA. This new office location is to be the setting for their newest 'Selling Sunset' spin off, 'Selling The Midwest'. Effective property pricing is a pivotal aspect of real estate sales, balancing the desire for optimal profits with the need to avoid prolonged market stays. Various factors come into play when determining the right property value, including total square footage, bedroom and bathroom count, and for some, additional features such as a tennis court. Recognizing the importance of precision in pricing, Jason and Brett have enlisted my expertise to develop a predictive model. The goal is to accurately forecast home sales prices, aiming for a mean cross-validation score of at least 0.80, ensuring their clients receive the best possible listing prices in the competitive real estate market.
